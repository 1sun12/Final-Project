It's also just to show off some things I learned on the side either through youtube videos or from the world wide web :). I had a great time with this class and I'm glad I learned so many things because this is a show case of all of that.</p>

						In my personal oponion I think this class was a huge success and I learned so much from it. I hope I'll be able to put all this knowledge to something productive and useful outside of class time. Although I can say confidently that both <strong>Frank</strong> and <strong>Roger</strong> did an outstanding job :).

					<h2>What I learned and what my favorite thing was ;D</h2>
				</div>
				<div class="col-lg-4">
					<p>I think my favorite part of the class was learning about how the game "Phaser" worked. I think that was also the one thing that clicked the fastest to me and it made just that much more sense when it was put in my hands to play and explore with it. If you already don't know I'm learning a lot about C# already right now and have been working on the study of Indie-Game-Dev for my own personal hobby. So I think learning about that even as small as it was, was also the kick starter I needed to look further into game dev.</p>

				  <h2>What could have been done better about the course.</h2>
			  </div>
			  <div class="col-lg-4">
				  <p>From what I have seen, I think the global debit cards could have been more organized as a majority of them weren't working from the start and I still have yet to see if my mine works. I also think that some parts of the course were completetly confusing and we never really had enough time to finish explaining some of those topics (For example: when everyone crashed and burned durring Figma) Although it's up to each of us individually to see how hard we work towards this class so it can be hard saying where the line draws from personal responsibility or having someone do it for you.</p>

				  <h2>My final thoughts: Conclusion</h2>
			  </div>
			  <div class="col-lg-4">
				  <p>What I can say confidently about this entire experience through this class weither or not I thought the entire thing was a train wreck or the best experience in my life. This class was a rather great success and I enjoyed it a lot. I can say I can walk away from this class with a new skill that would have been more confusing then ever to approach normally without the help of Frank or Roger introducing it to me and having faith that each and everyone one of us has the potential to get really good at this stuff. I hope this new-found skill will take me far and I hope to see what else I'll learn in the world of coding :). Thank you again Roger and Frank for this wonderful class and for teaching me this new skill.</p>
